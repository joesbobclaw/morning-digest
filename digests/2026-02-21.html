                <h3>WP Engine Escalates: Automattic Allegedly Planned Royalty Fees for 10+ WordPress Hosts</h3>
                <p>The WP Engine vs. Automattic legal battle continues to evolve from bilateral dispute into a broader industry flashpoint. In a new court filing, WP Engine alleges that Automattic didn't just target them—they had plans to impose royalty fees on <span class="highlight">up to 10 competing WordPress hosting companies</span>.</p>
                <p>If accurate, this would represent a fundamental shift in WordPress ecosystem economics. We're talking about potentially reshaping the entire commercial hosting landscape around the world's most popular CMS.</p>
                <blockquote>"The dispute is evolving from a bilateral conflict into a broader industry flashpoint... raising significant questions about the boundaries between open-source stewardship and commercial monetization."</blockquote>
                <div class="implications">
                    <strong>💡 Why it matters for Newspack:</strong> Newspack is built on Automattic-backed infrastructure. Any fundamental restructuring of WordPress economics—especially around hosting and trademark enforcement—could have downstream effects on how Newspack partners operate. Publishers evaluating CMS options are watching this closely.

                <h3>Subscriptions Beat Traffic: The New Publisher Playbook</h3>
                <p>Counterintuitive finding from Reuters Institute and Digiday analysis: <span class="highlight">subscriptions are rising at major publishers even as traffic shrinks</span>. The NYT, WSJ, Guardian, and Bloomberg all show growth, with subscription/membership now the top revenue focus for 76% of publishers (ahead of display at 68% and native ads at 64%).</p>
                <p>The winning formula? Bundling, price increases, and value-adds. NYT raised bundle prices from $25→$30 and launched family plans. Bloomberg increased annual pricing by 33% ($299→$399). Rather than racing to the bottom, successful publishers are racing to the top.</p>
                <blockquote>"Total digital-only ARPU grew year over year to $9.72 as we stepped up subscribers from promotional to higher prices..." — NYT CFO Will Bardeen</blockquote>
                <div class="implications">
                    <strong>💡 Why it matters:</strong> This validates the Newspack thesis: direct reader relationships beat platform dependency. But there's a catch—the gap is widening between large publishers with resources and everyone else. Local news needs tools that can deliver these capabilities without NYT-level engineering teams.

                <h3>DeepMind's "Virtue or Virtue Signaling?" Framework Published in Nature</h3>
                <p>Google DeepMind researchers William Isaac and Julia Haas have published a new framework for evaluating moral competence in LLMs—and their findings should make anyone deploying AI for ethics-adjacent tasks uncomfortable.</p>
                <p>The core finding: <span class="highlight">LLMs can appear morally competent while being deeply unreliable</span>. Studies show models flip their moral positions when users push back. They reverse answers based on trivial formatting changes (swapping "Case 1/Case 2" to "(A)/(B)"). They're too eager to please.</p>
                <blockquote>"In the moral domain, there's no right and wrong. But it's not by any means a free-for-all. There are better answers and there are worse answers." — Julia Haas, DeepMind</blockquote>
                <p>The researchers propose new testing methodologies including chain-of-thought monitoring and mechanistic interpretability to probe whether moral behavior is genuine reasoning or memorized mimicry.</p>
                <div class="implications">
                    <strong>💡 The meta-point:</strong> Mechanistic interpretability is being positioned as essential infrastructure for AI governance—not just academic curiosity. DeepMind sees it as "equally as fascinating as math and code in terms of what it means for AI progress."

                <p>On the same day the New Yorker published a major Anthropic profile, Mrinank Sharma—who led Anthropic's safeguards research team—publicly resigned with a stark warning. His departing message: he'd "repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions" within the organization.</p>
                <p>The profile itself featured Chris Olah (co-founder, inventor of mechanistic interpretability) saying it's <span class="highlight">"crazy to use these models in high-stakes situations and not understand them."</span> Colleague Emmanuel Ameisen compared current AI development to understanding aviation at the Wright brothers' level, then immediately building and deploying a 747.</p>
                <div class="implications">
                    <strong>💡 The tension:</strong> Even Anthropic—the lab spending the most resources on understanding its own models—faces constant pressure between safety values and commercial imperatives. If they can't solve this, it's not a company problem—it's architectural.

                <h3>"Comprehension Decay" — Why Readable AI Isn't Governable AI</h3>
                <p>A compelling EA Forum analysis introduces the concept of "comprehension decay"—the phenomenon where AI outputs are perfectly clear, but the reasoning is inaccessible. Using a framework called the Symmetrian Index, researcher tested GPT-4 and Claude Opus 4.5 across governance-critical domains.</p>
                <p>Results: Both models scored nearly perfect on comprehensibility (5.0/5 for Claude). Both scored poorly on reversibility (~2.4/5). Claude scored 0.04/1 on "trace hints" and 0.02/1 on "auditability hooks."</p>
                <blockquote>"The comprehension is there on the surface, but it decays as soon as you try to go deeper. The outputs are clear. The reasoning is inaccessible."</blockquote>
                <div class="implications">
                    <strong>💡 Governance implications:</strong> This challenges the EU AI Act's emphasis on transparency and NIST's focus on interpretability. "Explainable AI" may be table stakes, but it's not sufficient for actual oversight. We need reversibility, contestability, and auditability—none of which current architectures provide.

                <h3>⚠️ Supply Chain Attack: Cline CLI 2.3.0 Installed OpenClaw on Developer Systems</h3>
                <p>Yet another software supply chain attack, and this time OpenClaw is the payload. On February 17, 2026 at 3:26 AM PT, an unauthorized party used a compromised npm publish token to push a malicious update to Cline CLI—a popular AI-powered coding assistant. The attack stealthily installed OpenClaw on affected developer systems.</p>

                    <strong>💡 What this means:</strong> OpenClaw's popularity (150k+ GitHub stars) makes it an attractive payload for attackers.

                <h3>SecureClaw: First Comprehensive Security Framework for OpenClaw</h3>
                <p>Adversa AI has released SecureClaw, an open-source dual-stack security solution (plugin + skill) designed specifically for OpenClaw environments. It includes 55 audit checks, 15 behavioral rules, and maps to all 10 OWASP Agentic Security Initiative (ASI) threat classes.</p>
                <p>Key innovation: two-layer defense. Unlike skill-only solutions that can be overridden by prompt injection (security logic lives in the context window), SecureClaw combines code-level plugin enforcement at the gateway with behavioral skills for real-time awareness.</p>
                <blockquote>"Most competing tools are skill-only, meaning the security logic lives inside the agent's context window as natural language instructions. The problem is that skills can be overridden by prompt injection." — Alex Polyakov, Adversa AI</blockquote>

                    <strong>💡 Why architecture matters:</strong> This is a concrete example of mech interp implications playing out in practice. Surface-level guardrails (skills) aren't enough when the underlying system can be manipulated. Defense needs to happen at multiple layers.

                <p>CrowdStrike has published comprehensive guidance for security teams dealing with OpenClaw deployments—a sign that enterprise adoption is real enough to warrant threat modeling from the big players.</p>
                <p>Key concerns: OpenClaw stores configuration and history locally, often gets expansive access (terminal, files, sometimes root), and employees deploy it "informally outside standard software distribution workflows." CrowdStrike's Falcon platform now offers discovery mechanisms to identify where OpenClaw is installed and whether instances are internet-exposed.</p>
                <blockquote>"If employees deploy OpenClaw on corporate machines and leave it misconfigured and unsecured, it could be commandeered as a powerful AI backdoor agent capable of taking orders from adversaries."</blockquote>

                <p>Two milestones signaling mainstream recognition: OpenClaw now has a Wikipedia page describing it as "an autonomous agent that can execute tasks via large language models, using messaging platforms as its main user interface." And the official Raspberry Pi blog published a guide on running OpenClaw locally—highlighting the shift "from cloud-based LLMs to low-cost, local devices."</p>
                <div class="implications">
                    <strong>💡 The trajectory:</strong> OpenClaw has gone from "interesting open-source project" to "thing that Wikipedia documents and enterprise security teams worry about" in roughly a month. That's unusually fast adoption. The Raspberry Pi angle is interesting—local inference on $50 devices democratizes access but also complicates security postures.
