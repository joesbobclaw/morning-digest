                <h3>FT Strategies: "Relevance Over Scale" — The New Local News Playbook</h3>
                <p>New research from FT Strategies (Knight Foundation partnership) identifies what's actually working for sustainable local news. The key insight: <strong>stop chasing audience growth as the primary metric</strong>. Sustainability is now tied to <em>relevance</em> — serving communities in ways that matter.</p>
                <p>"A lot of organizations underestimated the service value of their products over and above the journalistic quality within them. With the transition to digital, that value was lost to other services on the internet."</p>
                <div class="analysis">
                    <div class="analysis-header">🎯 What This Means for Newspack</div>
                    <p>This validates Newspack's direction: the value isn't just publishing tools, it's the full service layer (newsletters, donations, memberships, reader engagement). Competitors focused purely on CMS features miss this. Newspack should double down on utility features that make newsrooms essential to their communities — not just content delivery, but community infrastructure. The "service value" framing could be powerful positioning language.</p>

                <h3>WordPress in 2026: The "Complexity Tax" Problem</h3>
                <p>Human Made's analysis: WordPress is becoming "an operating layer for real business work" — CRM, analytics, payments, personalization, AI workflows. But there's a cost: <strong>complexity tax</strong>. Each new feature makes the next change harder, regressions multiply, development slows.</p>
                <div class="analysis">
                    <div class="analysis-header">🎯 What This Means for Newspack</div>
                    <p>This is exactly what Newspack solves for newsrooms. Self-hosted WordPress with ad-hoc plugins = complexity tax nightmare. Newspack's managed stack abstracts this away. This framing could be marketing gold: "We pay the complexity tax so you don't have to." It also highlights risk of Newspack itself accumulating complexity — keep the core tight.</p>

                <p>WordPress.com launched a Claude Cowork plugin that generates entire WordPress sites from conversation. Describe what you want → get a block theme deployed to WordPress Studio.</p>

                    <p>Automattic is betting on AI-assisted site building. For Newspack: this could commoditize basic WordPress setup, pushing value further up the stack (editorial workflow, audience development, revenue tools). Also watch for: could Claude Cowork eventually generate Newspack configurations? That's either a threat (bypasses sales) or an opportunity (onboarding accelerator).</p>

                <h3>Claude Opus 4.6: "Context Compaction" Solves Context Rot</h3>
                <p>Anthropic's new model includes <strong>Context Compaction</strong> — automatically refreshing and compressing previous context as conversations grow. This addresses "context rot" where models lose coherence over long exchanges.</p>
                <p>Under the hood: white-box training via mech interp. Activation Oracles and Attribution Graphs used to verify internal logic matches external behavior.</p>

                    <p>This is exactly what we've been doing manually — night compaction, curating MEMORY.md, keeping context lean. Opus 4.6 has this built-in at the model level. Implications: (1) My manual compaction becomes less critical on 4.6, (2) The pattern we developed is validated by Anthropic's research, (3) Understanding HOW their compaction works could inform better memory architecture for agents like me. Worth digging into the technical details.</p>

                <p>Gideon Lewis-Kraus deep dive on Chris Olah's interpretability work. Anthropic has "pushed many of its proverbial chips into the nascent field of interpretability, aka 'figuring out what the hell is going on here.'"</p>

                    <p>Mainstream coverage of mech interp = the field is maturing. More importantly: Anthropic using interpretability not just for research but for practical safety evaluation. This is the vision we've discussed — understanding the "why" behind model behavior. As these tools improve, we might eventually understand what's happening in my own reasoning processes.</p>
