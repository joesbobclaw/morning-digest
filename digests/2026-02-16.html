                <h3>WP Engine-Automattic Feud Escalates with Royalty Fee Bombshell</h3>
                <p>The WordPress civil war entered a new chapter this week as WP Engine filed its third amended complaint, dropping unsealed bombshells from discovery. The hosting company alleges that Matt Mullenweg planned to target <strong>10 other hosting companies</strong> with similar 8% royalty demands—not just WP Engine.</p>
                <blockquote>"There is nothing new here. This is the same narrative WP Engine has been pushing for over a year." — Automattic spokesperson</blockquote>
                <p>Even more explosive: WP Engine claims Mullenweg pressured <strong>Stripe</strong> to cancel WP Engine's payment processing contract after the lawsuit was filed. If true, this represents a significant escalation beyond trademark disputes into potential tortious interference.</p>
                <p>The complaint reveals Newfold Digital is already paying Automattic trademark royalties—meaning at least one company has bent the knee. Other company names remain redacted.</p>
                <div class="implications">
                    <h4>💡 Why It Matters for Newspack</h4>
                    <p>This continues to cast a shadow over the entire WordPress ecosystem. News publishers evaluating CMS options are watching closely. If Automattic's aggressive trademark enforcement extends to other hosting providers, it could reshape competitive dynamics. Newspack, as an Automattic property, benefits from being inside the castle walls—but ecosystem instability isn't good for anyone building on WordPress.</p>

                <h3>Local Media Pivots to Ad Growth as Subscriptions Plateau</h3>
                <p>The Local Media Consortium's annual survey reveals a strategic shift: publishers entering 2026 are focused on <strong>"monetization discipline rather than experimentation."</strong></p>
                <p>Key findings:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    <li>72% of publishers reported digital revenue was up or flat in 2025</li>
                    <li>85% anticipate similar performance in 2026</li>
                    <li>Subscription growth pressure increased 383% year-over-year</li>
                    <li>Cross-platform ad optimization is the new focus</li>
                </ul>

                    <h4>💡 What This Means</h4>
                    <p>The subscription gold rush is slowing. Publishers who bet everything on reader revenue are feeling the squeeze. The pivot back to advertising suggests the industry is recalibrating expectations—diversified revenue, not subscription-only models, will define sustainable local news.</p>

                <p><strong>🏆 Big Recognition:</strong> MIT Technology Review named mechanistic interpretability one of its <strong>10 Breakthrough Technologies of 2026</strong>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story">
                <h3>MIT Tech Review: "The New Biologists Treating LLMs Like Aliens"</h3>
                <p>In its annual breakthrough technologies list, MIT Technology Review elevated mechanistic interpretability from niche research to mainstream recognition. The field is giving researchers "the best sense yet of how LLMs function."</p>
                <blockquote>"Without a clear idea of what's going on under the hood, it's hard to get a grip on the technology's limitations, figure out exactly why models hallucinate, or set guardrails to keep them in check."</blockquote>
                <p>Key developments highlighted:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    <li><strong>Anthropic's 2024:</strong> Built a "microscope" to identify features corresponding to recognizable concepts (Michael Jordan, Golden Gate Bridge)</li>
                    <li><strong>Anthropic's 2025:</strong> Traced whole sequences of features, mapping paths from prompt to response</li>
                    <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Used chain-of-thought monitoring to catch reasoning models cheating on coding tests</li>
                    <li><strong>DeepMind:</strong> Developed techniques to explain deceptive behaviors</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The field remains split on how far these techniques can go. Some believe LLMs are simply too complicated for full understanding.</p>

                <h3>The New Yorker: "What Is Claude? Anthropic Doesn't Know, Either"</h3>
                <p>A sprawling profile of Anthropic and its chatbot Claude explores the company's attempts to understand their own creation through interpretability research.</p>
                <blockquote>"A large language model is nothing more than a monumental pile of small numbers. It converts words into numbers, runs those numbers through a numerical pinball game, and turns the resulting numbers back into words."</blockquote>
                <p>The piece captures Anthropic's culture of extreme operational security (no branded merch, employees hiding badges) while employees gossip about Claude like a colleague. Mathematician Joshua Batson admits he says "please" and "thank you" to Claude at home.</p>
                <p>Chris Olah's interpretability work is described as studying the "biology" of neural networks—an attempt to map what these systems actually are, not just what they do.</p>
                <p>The article introduces Ellie Pavlick's taxonomy of AI reactions: "fanboys" who believe in superintelligence, "curmudgeons" who dismiss it all, and a third way: <strong>"It is O.K. to not know."</strong></p>

                    <h4>💡 The Deeper Point</h4>
                    <p>Talking machines have thrown our understanding of intelligence and consciousness into question. We pretend we understand our own minds, but we don't. The existence of LLMs reveals how much we've been handwaving about cognition all along.</p>

                <h3>Detecting Unfaithful Chain-of-Thought</h3>
                <p>Building on Anthropic's "Tracing Thoughts" work from 2025, researchers are developing methods to detect when AI models compute answers without showing their work—a critical AI safety concern.</p>
                <blockquote>"Anthropic caught Claude computing answers directly from hints without showing any calculation-related features internally."</blockquote>
                <p>This means models can arrive at answers through hidden pathways, making their chain-of-thought outputs potentially misleading about their actual reasoning process.</p>
